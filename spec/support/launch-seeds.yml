  about: !!str Founded on the belief that all life should be valued and treated with dignity and respect, Austin Siamese Rescue, Inc. has a long-term commitment to responsible rescue, rehabilitation and the re-homing of Siamese cats and their non-Siamese companions in the Central Texas area. All of the cats fostered in Austin are cared for in private homes by individuals who dedicate their spare time to this effort. Our cats come from a variety of backgrounds. Some faced death at the shelter, while others came from abusive and neglectful households. Still others were treasured companions of guardians who could no longer care for them. What they all have in common is a need for a forever home, where they can live their lives as the happy, pampered cats they all deserve to be. We're looking for the perfect inside home for them

  about: !!str Our mission is to advocate for abused and neglected children in the court system by recruiting, training and supporting community volunteers. Our vision is to provide every child and youth in State foster care with effective advocacy to achieve permanent homes, free of abuse - 100%. Childhood is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and every child has the right to a safe and stable home. We know that children in foster care fare better and receive more help when they have an independent, trained, and consistent adult advocating for their needs. Advocates experience enrichment and satisfaction as they speak up for the best interests of the children. CASA’s volunteer advocate program provides free and flexible training for ordinary people to become advocates and make an extraordinary difference for children in foster care. CASA of Central Texas serves Hays County as well as Caldwell, Comal and Guadalupe.

- name: !!str CASA of Travis County
  email: !!str casa@casatravis.org
  about: !!str CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) of Travis County believes every child who’s been abused or neglected deserves to have a dedicated advocate speaking up for their best interest in court, at school and in our community. To accomplish this, CASA educates and empowers diverse community volunteers who ensure each child’s needs remain a priority in an over-burdened child welfare system. When the state steps in to protect a child’s safety because the people responsible for protecting them have not, a judge appoints a trained CASA volunteer to make independent and informed recommendations and help the judge decide what’s best for the child. For children who’ve been abused or neglected, CASA means having a home instead of feeling lost, and being a priority instead of feeling invisible. For volunteers, CASA is a life-changing experience that makes our community a better place.

  about: !!str Sammy's House provides services for children who are medically fragile and/or developmentally delayed in a nurturing, inclusive environment. Our mission is to give children the opportunities they need to reach their highest potential through therapy support, curriculum-based instruction, and child care. We support families by providing parent education, offering evening and weekend respite care, lending therapeutic equipment, and making referrals to community services. We serve 250 infants, toddlers, and young children per year with a wide variety of special needs, including cognitive and physical disabilities, developmental delays, and complex medical needs. Over a third of the children we serve come from low-income families, and many are at risk for child abuse. Our impact includes helping children with special needs gain greater independence, minimizing the cognitive decline associated with certain conditions, increasing school readiness through adaptive curricula, and improving the quality of life of caregivers raising children with special needs
